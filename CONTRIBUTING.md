# Contributing

Contributing is great. Thank you.

Style guide:

* Headlines
  * We prefer sentence case over word-cap case. 
  * Right: "Foo goo hoo". 
  * Wrong: "Foo Goo Hoo".
  * Reason 1: it's easier for more cultures, easier to excerpt, and easier to transition among styles. 
  * Reason 2: it matches what big popular sites are doing for tech headlines; see Google blogs for examples.
* Tables
  * We prefer to implement tables using HTML over Markdown.
  * Reason: We aim for the [CommonMark specification](http://spec.commonmark.org/) and [cmark parser](https://github.com/commonmark/cmark), which are widespread industry standards, and these do not provide tables. We hope that CommonMark and cmark will add tables in the future.
